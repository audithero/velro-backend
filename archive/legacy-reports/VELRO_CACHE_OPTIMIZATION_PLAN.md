# Velro AI Platform Cache Optimization Plan
## Achieving >95% Cache Hit Rates and <5ms Access Times

### Executive Summary

Based on analysis of the existing multi-layer caching infrastructure, this plan provides focused optimizations to achieve:
- **Target cache hit rate**: >95% (current: 60%)
- **Target access time**: <5ms for L1, <20ms for L2
- **Authorization performance**: <75ms end-to-end

### Current State Analysis

**Existing Infrastructure:**
- âœ… L1 Memory Cache (Multi-layer cache manager)
- âœ… L2 Redis Cache (Circuit breaker, compression)  
- âœ… L3 Database Cache (Materialized views)
- âœ… Intelligent cache warming service
- âœ… Performance monitoring and alerting
- âœ… Enhanced authorization cache service

**Current Issues:**
- ðŸ”´ Cache hit rate only 60% vs 95% target
- ðŸ”´ Authorization caching not optimally configured
- ðŸ”´ Cache warming patterns not fully optimized
- ðŸ”´ Key patterns may not be supporting efficient lookups

## Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Enhanced Cache Key Patterns (Week 1)

**1.1 Authorization Cache Key Optimization**
- Implement hierarchical authorization cache keys
- Add user role-based cache segmentation
- Optimize TTL based on data stability

```python
# Current: auth:generation:user_id:gen_id:media_access
# Optimized: auth:user:123:role:owner:gen:456:read (hierarchical)
```

**1.2 User Data Cache Keys**
- Segment by access patterns (hot/warm/cold)
- Implement predictive key generation
- Add cross-reference keys for faster lookups

### Phase 2: Intelligent Cache Warming (Week 1-2)

**2.1 Startup Cache Warming Enhancement**
```python
Priority warming targets:
- Top 100 active users (last 24h) â†’ L1
- Recent 500 generations (last 48h) â†’ L1/L2  
- Active team memberships â†’ L2
- Authorization context for frequent operations â†’ L1
```

**2.2 Runtime Predictive Warming**
- User behavior pattern analysis
- Generation access prediction
- Team activity forecasting
- Session-based cache pre-loading

### Phase 3: TTL Configuration Optimization (Week 2)

**3.1 Data Type-Specific TTL Strategy**
```python
Optimized TTL Configuration:
- Authorization results: 900s (stable ownership)
- User sessions: 600s (medium volatility)
- Generation metadata: 300s (frequent updates)
- Team memberships: 1200s (semi-stable)
- System config: 3600s (very stable)
```

**3.2 Adaptive TTL Implementation**
- Access frequency-based TTL adjustment
- Data change rate monitoring
- User behavior pattern integration

### Phase 4: Cache Implementation Enhancements (Week 2-3)

**4.1 L1 Memory Cache Optimization**
- Increase allocation to 300MB (from 200MB)
- Implement hybrid eviction (LRU+LFU+Priority)
- Add compression for payloads >1KB
- Optimize serialization (pickle vs JSON)

**4.2 L2 Redis Cache Enhancement**  
- Connection pool optimization (25 connections)
- Pipeline operations for bulk operations
- Implement Redis cluster for high availability
- Add memory-efficient data structures

**4.3 Authorization Cache Service Integration**
- Direct L1 cache for frequent auth checks
- Batch authorization validation
- Context-aware cache invalidation
- Permission hierarchy caching
