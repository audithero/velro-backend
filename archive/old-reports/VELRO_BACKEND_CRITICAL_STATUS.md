# VELRO BACKEND CRITICAL STATUS REPORT

**Date**: August 15, 2025  
**Status**: ⚠️ CRITICAL - Backend API Non-Functional  
**Impact**: ALL API endpoints except basic health checks are failing

## Executive Summary

The Velro backend is experiencing a complete middleware failure that prevents ALL API functionality. This affects:
- ❌ User authentication
- ❌ Credit management  
- ❌ Project operations
- ❌ Generation services
- ❌ ALL router-based endpoints

Only the most basic inline health check endpoints are responding.

## Current Production Status

### Working (Very Limited)
- `/__diag/ping` - Returns 200 ✅
- `/__version` - Returns 200 ✅  
- `/health` - Returns 200 ✅

### FAILING (Everything Else)
- `/api/v1/credits/*` - ALL return 500 ❌
- `/api/v1/projects/*` - ALL return 500 ❌
- `/api/v1/generations/*` - ALL return 500 ❌
- `/api/v1/auth/*` - ALL return 500 ❌
- Even ping endpoints return 500 ❌
- CORS headers missing on ALL error responses ❌

## Root Cause

**PRIMARY ISSUE**: Middleware stack is crashing before requests reach any routers.

**SPECIFIC ERROR**: 
```
ERROR:middleware.auth:Unexpected error in token verification: 
'AsyncAuthService' object has no attribute 'verify_token_http'
```

This causes a cascade failure:
1. Auth middleware crashes
2. Rate limiter crashes due to auth failure
3. Access control denies everything
4. CORS middleware never gets to add headers
5. ALL requests return 500 without CORS

## Fixes Attempted

### ✅ Completed
1. **Added missing method** - `verify_token_http` added to AsyncAuthService
2. **Created diagnostic router** - For troubleshooting (also fails due to middleware)
3. **Added inline ping endpoints** - Direct registration (still fail)
4. **Created minimal test app** - Works perfectly with just CORS
5. **Added emergency bypass mode** - `BYPASS_ALL_MIDDLEWARE` environment variable
6. **Set bypass flag in Railway** - Variable added to production

### ❌ Failed
1. **Deployments failing** - New deployments won't start (build issue?)
2. **Service stuck on old code** - Running deployment from 1:40 PM
3. **Cannot update production** - Deployments fail before starting

## Railway Deployment Status

```
Recent Deployments:
- e959930e (7ce9ce9) - FAILED - Emergency bypass mode
- d0630274 (869cf7a) - FAILED - Auth fix
- d604a169 (38a0199) - FAILED - Defensive fixes
- 00bf6d8d - SUCCESS - Currently running (old code)
```

**PROBLEM**: Railway cannot deploy new code. All new deployments fail.

## Immediate Actions Required

### Option 1: Force Redeploy Working Version
```bash
# Find last known good commit
git log --oneline | grep -B5 "00bf6d8d"

# Force deploy that commit
railway up --detach
```

### Option 2: Emergency Rollback
1. Revert to simpler main.py without complex middleware
2. Use main_minimal.py as temporary replacement
3. Deploy minimal version to restore service

### Option 3: Direct Railway Fix
1. SSH into Railway container (if possible)
2. Set environment variable directly
3. Restart service manually

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test current status
./scripts/test-diagnostic-endpoints.sh

# Test specific endpoint
curl -i https://velro-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/credits/_ping

# Check CORS headers
curl -i -H "Origin: https://velro.ai" \
  https://velro-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/credits/stats
```

## Environment Variables Needed

```bash
# Emergency recovery mode
BYPASS_ALL_MIDDLEWARE=true

# Or disable heavy middleware
DISABLE_HEAVY_MIDDLEWARE=true
```

## Files Created/Modified

1. `services/auth_service_async.py` - Added missing method ✅
2. `main.py` - Added bypass mode and defensive coding ✅
3. `routers/diagnostics_deep.py` - Diagnostic endpoints ✅
4. `main_minimal.py` - Minimal working app ✅
5. `scripts/test-diagnostic-endpoints.sh` - Testing script ✅
6. `MIDDLEWARE_CRASH_DIAGNOSIS.md` - Detailed diagnosis ✅

## Critical Path Forward

### IMMEDIATE (Today)
1. **Get deployments working** - Investigate Railway build failures
2. **Deploy bypass mode** - Get BYPASS_ALL_MIDDLEWARE active
3. **Restore basic functionality** - At least auth and credits

### SHORT-TERM (Tomorrow)
1. **Fix each middleware** - Test individually
2. **Remove problematic middleware** - Temporarily disable breaking ones
3. **Add monitoring** - Log middleware entry/exit

### LONG-TERM (This Week)
1. **Refactor middleware stack** - Make it resilient
2. **Add circuit breakers** - Prevent cascade failures
3. **Improve error handling** - Graceful degradation

## Success Metrics

Minimum viable backend:
- [ ] Auth endpoints return 401 (not 500) without token
- [ ] CORS headers present on ALL responses
- [ ] Credits API functional
- [ ] Projects API functional
- [ ] New deployments succeed

## Conclusion

The backend is in a critical state with a complete middleware failure preventing all API operations. The immediate priority is to:

1. Get new deployments working on Railway
2. Activate the emergency bypass mode
3. Restore basic API functionality

Without these fixes, the entire Velro application is non-functional.

## Contact

For urgent assistance:
- Check Railway deployment logs
- Review GitHub commit 7ce9ce9 for latest fixes
- Test with bypass mode enabled

**Status**: AWAITING DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS TO APPLY FIXES
