# ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT RECOVERY GUIDE

## CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED
**ROOT CAUSE**: Railway service `velro-production` is completely missing or disconnected from the project.

## EVIDENCE
1. âœ… All endpoints return Railway's "Application not found" (404) error
2. âœ… `railway domain` returns "Project does not have any services"  
3. âœ… `railway connect velro-production` returns "Service not found"
4. âœ… `railway up` fails with "404 Not Found"
5. âœ… No deployment logs available

## IMMEDIATE RECOVERY STEPS

### Step 1: Create New Railway Service
```bash
# Connect to the correct Railway project
railway link

# Create a new service (since the old one is missing)
railway up --detach
```

### Step 2: Alternative Manual Deployment
If Step 1 fails, manually create service:
```bash
# Create new service via Railway dashboard
# Then link it locally
railway service <new-service-id>
railway up --detach
```

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variables
Ensure these environment variables are set in Railway dashboard:
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` 
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`
- `FAL_API_KEY`
- `REDIS_URL`
- `PORT=8000`

### Step 4: Test Deployment
```bash
# Wait for deployment to complete, then test
curl -v https://velro-backend-production.up.railway.app/
curl -v https://velro-backend-production.up.railway.app/health
```

## ROUTE REGISTRATION ANALYSIS
The FastAPI code structure is **CORRECT**:
- âœ… `main.py` properly registers all routers with prefixes
- âœ… `routers/auth.py` defines router with `/auth` prefix  
- âœ… Auth endpoints should be at `/api/v1/auth/login`
- âœ… Try-catch blocks handle import failures gracefully

## EXPECTED ENDPOINTS (Once Service is Restored)
- `GET /` - Root endpoint with API info
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /docs` - FastAPI documentation  
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/v1/auth/register` - User registration
- `GET /api/v1/auth/me` - Current user info

## MONITORING COMMANDS
```bash
# Check deployment status
railway status

# View deployment logs
railway logs

# Check service domain
railway domain
```

## PREVENTION
- Set up Railway deployment monitoring
- Configure health check alerts
- Regular backup of Railway configuration
- Document service IDs and links
