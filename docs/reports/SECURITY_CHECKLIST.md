# HTTPS Security Checklist for Velro Backend

## Production Deployment Security ✅

### HTTPS Enforcement
- [ ] Verify `https_enforcement: true` in `/security-status`
- [ ] Check `Strict-Transport-Security` header presence
- [ ] Confirm `upgrade-insecure-requests` in CSP
- [ ] Test redirect behavior preserves HTTPS protocol

### Railway Platform Security
- [ ] Validate `x-forwarded-proto` header handling
- [ ] Confirm automatic HTTPS certificate renewal
- [ ] Verify production environment detection
- [ ] Check Railway health check endpoints

### Security Headers Validation
- [ ] `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- [ ] `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- [ ] `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- [ ] `Content-Security-Policy` with HTTPS enforcement
- [ ] `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

## Development Security

### Code Review Requirements
- [ ] All redirect logic preserves original protocol
- [ ] No hardcoded HTTP URLs in production code
- [ ] Environment-based security configurations
- [ ] Proper error handling for security failures

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Security header validation tests
- [ ] HTTPS redirect behavior tests
- [ ] Protocol downgrade prevention tests
- [ ] Railway proxy header tests

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Security Metrics
- [ ] Monitor `X-Forwarded-Proto-Status` headers
- [ ] Track `insecure-detected` occurrences
- [ ] Alert on HTTP→HTTPS redirect volumes
- [ ] Monitor CSP violation reports

### Performance Impact
- [ ] Measure redirect latency impact
- [ ] Monitor security middleware overhead
- [ ] Track HTTPS adoption rates
- [ ] Validate Railway edge performance

## Incident Response

### Protocol Downgrade Detection
1. Monitor logs for `insecure-detected` status
2. Alert on unexpected HTTP traffic patterns
3. Verify client HTTPS adoption
4. Review Railway proxy configuration

### Emergency Procedures
1. Immediate HTTPS enforcement toggle
2. Security header emergency deployment
3. Railway platform status verification
4. Client notification procedures
