## üîÑ ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### Instant Rollback Capability
The deployment maintains instant rollback capability at every phase:

#### Emergency Rollback Triggers:
- **Manual**: Triggered by operations team
- **Automated**: Health check failures, performance degradation
- **User Reports**: Critical functionality broken

#### Rollback Actions by Phase:

##### Phase 2 Rollback (Database):
```bash
# Restore from backup
# 1. Access Supabase dashboard
# 2. Navigate to Database > Backups
# 3. Restore from backup ID: pre-team-collab-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS

# Or emergency SQL rollback:
# Execute rollback commands in migration file comments
```

##### Phase 3 Rollback (Backend):
```bash
# Railway service rollback
railway rollback --service velro-003-backend-production

# Or set Kong emergency bypass
railway variables set KONG_EMERGENCY_BYPASS=true --service velro-003-backend-production
```

##### Phase 4 Rollback (Frontend):
```bash
# Railway service rollback  
railway rollback --service velro-003-frontend-production
```

##### Phase 5 Rollback (Traffic):
```bash
# Kong Gateway emergency bypass
railway variables set KONG_EMERGENCY_BYPASS=true --service kong-production
railway variables set KONG_PROXY_ENABLED=false --service velro-003-backend-production
```

#### Full System Rollback:
```bash
# Execute emergency rollback workflow
gh workflow run production-deployment.yml \
  -f deployment_phase=rollback \
  -f environment=production \
  -f rollback_version="pre-deployment-stable"
```

## üìä MONITORING & VALIDATION

### Health Check Endpoints:
```bash
# Kong Gateway
curl https://kong-production.up.railway.app/
# Expected: HTTP 401 (authentication required = working)

# Backend API  
curl https://velro-003-backend-production.up.railway.app/health
# Expected: HTTP 200 with health status

# Frontend UI
curl https://velro-003-frontend-production.up.railway.app/
# Expected: HTTP 200 with HTML content

# Database (via backend)
curl https://velro-003-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/health/database  
# Expected: HTTP 200 with database status
```

### Performance Baselines:
- **API Response Time**: < 500ms average
- **Database Query Time**: < 100ms average
- **Frontend Load Time**: < 2 seconds
- **Kong Gateway Latency**: < 50ms overhead

### Alerting Thresholds:
- **Error Rate**: > 1% triggers warning, > 5% triggers rollback
- **Response Time**: > 2 seconds triggers investigation
- **Availability**: < 99.5% triggers immediate attention
- **Database Connections**: > 80% capacity triggers scaling

---

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

- **Kong Gateway**: API key authentication on all routes
- **Rate Limiting**: Configured per service (5-25 requests/minute)
- **CORS**: Restricted to production frontend origin
- **Request Size**: Limited to 50MB (100MB for video services)

### Database Security:
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Enabled on all team tables
- **Role-based Access**: Owner/Admin/Editor/Viewer roles
- **Data Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
