# Deployment Testing Plan - Velro Backend

## Overview
Comprehensive testing procedures to validate all deployment fixes before Railway production deployment.

## Pre-Deployment Testing Checklist

### 1. Nixpacks Configuration Testing
- [ ] Validate nixpacks.toml syntax and configuration
- [ ] Test start command and port binding
- [ ] Verify build command execution
- [ ] Validate environment variable handling

### 2. FastAPI Application Testing
- [ ] Local startup with Railway-like environment
- [ ] Health check endpoint validation
- [ ] Authentication flow testing
- [ ] API endpoint functionality
- [ ] Error handling and middleware stack

### 3. Database Connectivity Testing
- [ ] Supabase connection validation
- [ ] Migration execution testing
- [ ] RLS policy verification
- [ ] Database health check

### 4. Environment Variables Testing
- [ ] Required environment variables present
- [ ] Configuration loading validation
- [ ] Secrets and API keys verification
- [ ] Production vs development settings

### 5. Dependencies and Requirements
- [ ] requirements.txt validation
- [ ] Package compatibility testing
- [ ] Version conflict resolution
- [ ] Build process validation

### 6. Security and Performance
- [ ] Rate limiting functionality
- [ ] CORS configuration testing
- [ ] Security headers validation
- [ ] Request/response timing

## Test Execution Sequence

1. **Local Environment Setup**
2. **Configuration Validation**
3. **Application Startup Testing**
4. **API Endpoint Validation**
5. **Database Integration Testing**
6. **Security Feature Testing**
7. **Performance Validation**
8. **Deployment Readiness Check**

## Success Criteria

- All health checks pass
- API endpoints respond correctly
- Database connectivity established
- Authentication flow functional
- No critical errors in logs
- Performance within acceptable limits

## Railway Deployment Validation

Final validation steps for Railway deployment:
1. Staging environment testing
2. Production deployment monitoring
3. Post-deployment validation
4. Rollback procedures (if needed)
